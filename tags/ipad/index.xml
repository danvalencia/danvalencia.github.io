Specifically I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on the electronics, which is a fairly big chunk of work. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you to the project and show you some of the work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing to make this a reality.
Intro The installation consists of 2 hands with the palms facing upwards. The hands will be made out of CDX plywood and the piece is designed to be assembled as a huge 3D jigsaw puzzle.</description></item></channel></rss>
