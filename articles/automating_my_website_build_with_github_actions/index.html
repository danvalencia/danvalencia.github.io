Like any piece of software, a website needs constant care and things end up breaking if you abandon it. In this post I&rsquo;ll discuss how I revamped my site and automated my site&rsquo;s build using Github Actions.</p><h2 id=the-original-setup>The original setup</h2><p>I built this website from the beginning with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>, which is a very popular static site generator written in Go. I&rsquo;ve been very happy with it: it&rsquo;s very easy to setup, it&rsquo;s fast, and it uses Markdown which is my favorite language for writing.</p><p>In Hugo, the content - written in Markdown - is stored under a directory called <code>/content</code>, and the site is compiled under the <code>public</code> directory.</p><p>When I originally setup this blog I didn&rsquo;t have a CI process in place for building it, so I ended up having 2 repositories: one where I kept all the Hugo structure and the content and a separate repository for the published site.</p><p>With this approach I had to:</p><ul><li>Build the site (with <code>hugo</code> command).<br></li><li>Copy over the contents of the <code>/public</code> directory to the published site repo.<br></li><li>Commit my changes in both repos.<br></li><li>Finally, push to Github.</li></ul><p>This worked ok for a while, but every article I wanted to write required too many steps, and it quickly got old, resulting in me writing less and less, to the point of abandoning my blog altogether.</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve felt the need to write more, so I decided to fix this issue and revamp my site. My goal was to make so that the publishing process doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of the writing. From experience I can say tha having a frictionless blogging setup is key to not lose interest in the important part, <em>the writing</em>.</p><h2 id=github-pages>Github Pages</h2><p>Github Pages is a feature from Github that allows to host a static HTML site under any repository. This is very useful if you want to host the documentation of your project alongside the code, for example.</p><p>In the context of Github Pages there are 2 kinds of repos:
* Personal or Organization repositories: the name of the repo should be <em>&lt;user-or-org&gt;</em>.github.io. GH Pages sites built from a personal or org repo are published from the master branch by default.
* Project repositories: they can have any name. GH Pages sites built from a project repo are published by default from the <em>gh-pages</em> branch.</p><p>Given that mine is personal site I created the <em>danvalencia.github.io</em> repo.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s a personal site, the <em>master</em> branch needs to contain the published site. I created a separate <em>author</em> branch to host the content and I setup this branch as the default branch for the repo, this way when cloning from scratch you&rsquo;ll be checked out automatically in <code>author</code>.</p><p>Ok, so by now, I had my repo with 2 branches: <em>author</em> and <em>master</em>.</p><h2 id=automating-the-build>Automating the build</h2><p>Building the site locally is as easy as running:</p><pre><code>&gt; hugo
</code></pre><p>You can install <code>hugo</code> command on a Mac by running <code>brew install hugo</code>.</p><p>But how could I run this command automatically on git push ?</p><h3 id=enter-github-actions>Enter Github Actions</h3><p>I&rsquo;d heard about Github Actions when it first was released a few months ago, and thought it was a super nice feature which could be used to run your CI pipeline. I figured it would be a good fit for building my site.</p><p>Within Github Actions you can create Workflows which are a series of steps that perform several tasks. You can choose to build your own actions or you can choose from existing actions that are published in the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">Github Marketplace</a>.</p><p>Github Actions end up being a combination of a Docker images and scripts that execute within Docker images. The cool thing about this approach is that because it&rsquo;s Docker based it can contain virtually any base software, and thus you can automate build for any programming stack. I&rsquo;m not sure about the constraints of storage and memory, though.</p><h4 id=workflow-configuration>Workflow Configuration</h4><p>Like most configurations nowadays, Github Actions workflows are defined with YAML files you add to your repository&rsquo;s <em>.github/workflows</em> directory.</p><p>A workflow gets triggered by an event, such as a push or pull request creation. In the following example the workflow get&rsquo;s triggered on a <em>push</em> event from the <em>author</em> branch:</p><pre><code>on:
  push:
    branches:
    - author
</code></pre><p>Then you specify jobs that need to run for this workflow. For each job you specify the docker image to use, like so:</p><pre><code>jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
</code></pre><p>Now you specify a list of steps to run, which can be external actions or scripts:</p><pre><code>    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        submodules: true

    - name: Setup Hugo
      uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
      with:
        hugo-version: '0.59.1'

    - name: Build
      run: hugo --minify

    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v2.5.0
      env:
        ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
        PUBLISH_BRANCH: master
        PUBLISH_DIR: ./public
</code></pre><p>The steps are mostly self explanatory. In laymans terms:</p><ul><li>Checkout the repo, with submodules.<br></li><li>Install Hugo version &lsquo;0.59.1&rsquo;.<br></li><li>Run the build with <code>hugo --minify</code>.<br></li><li>Deploy the site by pushing the <code>./public</code> directory to the <code>master</code> branch.</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s it!</p><h4 id=secrets-in-github-actions>Secrets in Github Actions</h4><p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to point out is the use of <code>${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}</code>. As you can probably infer, we&rsquo;re referencing a secret named <code>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</code>. But where does this come from, and what is it for, you may ask ?</p><p>This is the secret that Github Actions will use to push to a repo. In this case we&rsquo;re <em>pushing</em> to the current repo, which means that the secret needs to have write permissions to the repo.</p><p>How can you create one, you may ask ? Glad you asked:</p><ul><li>First step is to create an SSH key. From a Mac:<br><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;youremail@foo.com&quot; -f mysite</code><br>This command will create a public and private key pair named <em>mysite.pub</em> and <em>mysite</em>, accordingly.<br></li><li>Copy the <em>private</em> key (e.g. <code>pbcopy &lt; mysite</code>) and create a secret named <em>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</em> from the repo&rsquo;s <em>Settings</em> page:<br><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/danvalencia_my_site/github_secrets.png alt="Github Secrets"><br></li><li>Copy the <em>public</em> key (e.g. <code>pbcopy &lt; mysite.pub</code>) and create a deploy key named <em>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</em> from the repo&rsquo;s <em>Settings</em> page:<br><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/danvalencia_my_site/github_deploy_keys.png alt="Github Secrets"><br>Make sure you check the <em>Allow write access</em> checkbox.<ul><li>Once the deploy key is created you should be able to use it in Github Actions.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=putting-it-all-together>Putting it all together</h2><p>With Github Actions in place, my writing flow works is now as simple as:</p><ul><li>Create a new article with <code>hugo new content/articles/my_awesome_new_article.md</code>.<br></li><li>Write the article.<br></li><li>Commit and push the article:<br><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;My new article&quot; &amp;&amp; git push origin author</code></li></ul><p>See it in <em>Action</em>:<br><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/danvalencia_my_site/github_actions_in_action.png alt="Github Actions in Action"></p><p>Now I can focus 100% on writing and let Github do the rest!</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>Hugo Github Action: <a href=https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo>https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo</a>.<br></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 0 1-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 0 1 0 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://www.danvalencia.dev/tags/tutorials>tutorials</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://www.danvalencia.dev/tags/github-actions>github actions</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://www.danvalencia.dev/tags/writing>writing</a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
