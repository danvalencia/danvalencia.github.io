## Daniel Valencia Backhoff, Software Engineer

### Professional Summary

I have over 15 years of experience as a software engineer and technical leader across a diverse set of projects that span from greenfield development to complex integration projects with startups and enterprises in the fields of retail, media, real estate, and AEC.

I am a generalist that enjoys a good challenge. My strength lies on my breadth of experience: backend development, UI, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA, performance/load testing, and people management. I have strong expertise in web application development using Java and Javascript and I'm also proficient in other languages and platforms such as Javascript, Go, Ruby on Rails, Python and iOS.

I treat software development as a craft, and I like my code well tested. I know that test coverage is important, but 100% coverage is impractical. I've done TDD and pair programming enough to understand its value, but I'm also pragmatic and understand that prototyping sometimes requires different approaches.

Collaboration is important to me, and I love bouncing ideas with fellow teammates. I enjoy mentoring fellow engineers (and also love being mentored!) and have held people management and leadership positions.
