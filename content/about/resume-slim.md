## Daniel Valencia Backhoff, Software Engineer

### Professional Summary  

I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer and technical lead across a diverse set of projects that span from greenfield development to big complex integration projects with startups and enterprises in the fields of eCommerce, media, real estate, and AEC.

I am a generalist that enjoys a good challenge. My strength lies on my breadth of experience: backend development, UI, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA, performance/load testing, and people management. I have strong expertise in Java based web application development and I'm also proficient in other languages and platforms such as Javascript, Go, Ruby on Rails, Python and iOS. 

I treat software development as a craft, and I like my code well tested. I know that test coverage is important, but 100% coverage is impractical. I've done TDD and pair programming enough to understand its value, but I'm also pragmatic and understand that prototyping sometimes requires different approaches.  

Collaboration is very important to me: I love a good old whiteboarding session with fellow teammates and I enjoy mentoring fellow engineers.
