Daniel Valencia Backhoff, Software Engineer Professional Summary I have over 15 years of experience as a software engineer and technical leader across a diverse set of projects that span from greenfield development to complex integration projects with startups and enterprises in the fields of retail, media, real estate, and AEC.
I am a generalist that enjoys a good challenge. My strength lies on my breadth of experience: backend development, UI, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA, performance/load testing, and people management.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://www.danvalencia.dev/about/me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.danvalencia.dev/about/me/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software developer from Ensenada, MÃ©xico, currently working as a Director of Engineering at HELIX RE, in San Francisco, California.
I&amp;rsquo;d say curiosity is one of my biggest strengths, and that has helped me get involved in the entire software development stack: from frontend, backend, and mobile app development to infrastructure engineering, QA, and performance testing. I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist at heart who loves solving hard problems; I&amp;rsquo;m a generalist who believes in using the right tool for the job.</description></item></channel></rss>
