Daniel Valencia Backhoff, Software Engineer Professional Summary I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer and technical lead across a diverse set of projects that span from greenfield development to big complex integration projects with startups and enterprises in the fields of eCommerce, media, real estate, and AEC.

I&amp;rsquo;d say curiosity is one of my biggest strengths, and that has helped me get involved in the entire software development stack: from frontend, backend, and mobile app development to infrastructure engineering, QA, and performance testing. I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist at heart who loves solving hard problems; I&amp;rsquo;m a generalist who believes in using the right tool for the job.</description></item></channel></rss>
