My strength lies on my breadth of experience: backend development, UI, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA, performance/load testing, and people management.

I enjoy mentoring fellow engineers and have held people management and leadership positions.</p><h3 id=helix-re-inc-san-francisco-ca-february-2018-current>HELIX RE Inc, San Francisco, CA (February 2018 - current)</h3><h4 id=senior-software-engineer><em>Senior Software Engineer</em></h4><p>As a founding engineer for HELIX, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to design and build our cloud platform from scratch.
